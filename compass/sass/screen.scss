// It is suggested that you use Sass's @extend directive to apply the PIE
// behavior to your elements. Setting this variable will tell the `pie` mixin
// to extend it. Or you can just extend the base class yourself.
$pie-base-class: pie-element;
// There are two approaches to creating PIE elements
// The default approach is to make the element position: relative.
.pie-element {
  // relative is the default, so passing relative

  @include background(linear-gradient(#f00, #00f));

// But sometimes this messes up your positioning
// So you can also use z-indexing. In this case
// an ancestor element before or having the first
// opaque background should be marked as a pie-container
// which gives it a z-index of 0 (actually any z-index
// can be provided to the pie-container mixin).
// And then the pie element itself should be given
// a z-index of -1.
.pie-container {
  @include pie-container;
}
.z-pie-element {
  // this will get a z-index of 0, you can pass a z-index value if you want
  @include pie-element(1);
}
// This is just a simple example of how to use the z-index approach.
.widget {
  @extend .pie-container;
